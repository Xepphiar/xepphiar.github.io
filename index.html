        <p>osu! has multiple gamemodes (Standard, Mania, Taiko, and CtB), but from here on osu! will refer to osu! Standard.</p>
        <img src="resources/circles.jpg">
        <p>Each note has an approach circle. When the approach circle reaches the outer edge of the note, you press the mouse button. Timing is key.</p>
        <p>There are also sliders and spinners. For sliders you drag your cursor along the slider track and for spinners you spin your mouse in a circle.</p>
        <p>Beatmaps (songs) are classified by difficulty, from easiest to hardest: Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, Expert, and Expert Plus.</p>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>osu! features a wide variety of music: pop, soundtrack, anime, electronic, rock, k-pop, etc. This is because the community makes the maps, instead of the developers.</p>
        <p>Music is what makes osu! "cross cultural."</p>

        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>There are <a target="_blank" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums">community forums</a> where all sorts of people have all sorts of discussions.</p>
        <p>While Dean Herbert is the original creator, osu! is partially being developed by volunteer community members.</p>
        <p>There are both official and community hosted tournaments. Tournaments are often broadcasted on Twitch.</p>
